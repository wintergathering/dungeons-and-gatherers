  <section class="post-content"><p>After recovering from their fits of sneezing and choking, the NDA take the opportunity to further question Sir Talavar. The little purple faerie dragon tells them his backstory – that he is an ambassador of the Seelie Court and the Summer Queen who had come to Prismeer to recruit Zybylna as an ally against the Seelie Court’s sworn enemies, the fomorians. However, upon arriving in Prismeer, Sir T discovered that the Hourglass Coven – the trio of Bavlorna, Skabatha, and Endelyn – had used Iggwilv’s Cauldron to freeze time in Zybylna’s palace and take control of Prismeer for themselves. Citing a great urgency to get back to his queen and inform her of this treachery, Sir Talavar urges the NDA to free him from his little prison.</p>
<p>Although they’re unsure of whether they can trust him, the party agrees to try to find Jingle Jangle, a goblin who Sir Talavar claims collects keys, as she will surely have the ability to unlock this impenetrable prison (i.e. a tiny lil silver cage that happens to be magically locked). En route to JJ’s cave dwelling on Telemy Hill – a magical hill that, much to the party’s dismay, actually moves around the realm of Hither – the NDA stumbles into a gang of hobgoblin stilt walkers. Still trying to wrap his little rat brain around the customs of the realm, Renis tries to cite the Rule of Reciprocity to make the hobgoblins give him their stilts/shoes, but instead ends up trading some of his trash for some of their (very fine) pocket lint.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/FdUuWaN.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>It turns out that the hobgoblins are egg traders on their way to Downfall – Bavlorna Blightstraw’s home – to exchange their sweet sweet eggs for some cash. And unbeknownst to the DM, the NDA are apparently egg connoisseurs. Ankor buys an assortment of eggs, Strowkin buys a literal handful of frog eggs, and Korv buys a rare pterradon egg, which will (allegedly) increase the volume of his ejaculate. With these various load-enhancing and non-load-enhancing eggs in their possession, the party treks on toward Telemy Hill, which they find before too long.</p>
<p><img src="https://c.tenor.com/XkeeOhkIH3QAAAAC/donald-duck-boner.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>Arriving at Telemy Hill, the gang is greeted by a group of awakened trees, who tell the party how to find JJ but also claim that they will not hesitate to fuck the NDA up if they so much as a lay a finger on their friend Jingle Jangle, who had recently been bonked pretty good by a gang of harengon bandits. This is actually great news for the NDA, since they’d just recently beat the little rabbit cheeks (and performed forceful dental extractions) of a gang of harengon bandits, and they readily explain to JJ that they have avenged her bonking, offering her a rabbit tooth as evidence of their swift vengeance.</p>
<p>Jingle Jangle approves of this and offers the key to Sir Talavar’s cage as a thank-you. However, it appears that some of the younger awakened trees have taken the silver key as a prank, and they refuse to give it back. Trying to snatch the key from Trevor the tree’s upper branches, Korv yeets Yendar about 25 feet in the air, and Yendar grabs hold of a branch.</p>
<p><img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/682199fd-b177-4f62-bcd1-889559165234/scale-to-width/755" alt=""></p>
<p>But before Yendar can snag the key, Trevor chucks it over to Kyle (another tree). Unwilling to play keep-away with a bunch of fucking trees, Yendar decides to cast the “friends” spell on Kyle and forces him to drop the key, which the gang then collects.</p>
<p>Still unsure of whether or not to trust Sir Talavar, the NDA ties a little rope around his ankles before unlocking the cage, which Sir T reluctantly obliges. Nevertheless, Sir Talavar proves himself a true and honorable knight by fulfilling his end of the bargain and offering up his tiny sword (functionally a +1 magic dagger) as a reward for freeing him. He also assures the NDA that the Summer Queen will grant them a boon at some point in the future when they need it most. And, finally, because this is apparently what people do when in the presence of the NDA, he also proffers to them one of his very own teeny little teeth.</p>
