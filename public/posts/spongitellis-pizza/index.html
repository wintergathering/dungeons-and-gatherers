  <section class="post-content"><p>Trekking in the direction of the balloon crash, accompanied by Chet Chadly and the giant snail, the NDA finds themselves in the middle of a swamp, whose waters rise quickly and force the smaller members of the party to seek refuge, either on the shoulders of their friends or on Tensor’s Floating Disk. Tall enough to keep their heads above water, Korv and Strowkin continue wading through the swamp. However, unable to see the ground beneath their feet, they walk straight into a pit of quicksand</p>

<p>Thinking quickly, Renis deploys his immovable rod above Korv, who grabs the rod to avoid sinking into the sticky sand. Strowkin is not so lucky, though, and sinks 4 feet into the sand before Ankor and Korv tie a rope to the immovable rod, which allows Strowkin to pull himself free. After conquering the quicksand boss that could have taken the entire session to defeat, the NDA continues on toward the balloon crash.</p>
<p>As they approach, they see a slanted tower sitting atop a gently-rising hill, and skewered on one of the spires of the tower is a balloon, its basket dangling about 30 feet above the ground. While the NDA debates how best to get to the basket, they hear a whisper from above, which comes from a small purple faerie dragon named Sir Talavar. It turns out that Sir Talavar is an emissary from the Seelie Court and the Summer Queen, and he was sent to Prismeer to recruit Zybilna as an ally against the Seelie Court’s enemies, the fomorians. However, when he arrived in Prismeer, he found Bavlorna Blightstraw (rather than Zybilna) ruling over Hither, and Bavlorna quickly locked him in a magical cage. Moved by Sir Talavar’s plight, the faerie dragon was rescued by Sir Wigglewog, and the two escaped Bavlorna’s clutches via balloon. However, the balloon was struck down by an air elemental, and crashed into the tower. Unfortunately, Sir Wigglewog did not survive the crash, and the brave bullywog’s body has been just, like, oozing next to Sir Talavar for who knows how long.</p>
<p>Sir Talavar also points out a pair of giant constrictor snakes and a centaur snoozing at the base of the tower. These foes were sent by Bavlorna to retrieve Sir Talavar, but are too lazy to climb the tower and are instead waiting for the balloon basket to fall.</p>
<p>Deciding to help Sir Talavar – as well as potentially harvest some new teeth and find opportunities to shove the immovable rod up the butts of some unfortunate enemies – the NDA hatches a plan to attack Bavlorna’s minions that begins with Renis using the spider climb plushie he’d won at the carnival to scale the tower and climb into the dangling balloon basket. Afterward, the remainder of the party inched closer to the tower, until an overloud call from Strowkin – probably about sandwiches or some other bullshit – awakened the sneks and centaur.</p>

<p>Combat began with Vinny C, the pizza-aficionado centaur, charging Korv and absolutely blasting him for most of his health (which caused some momentary panic in the DM that perhaps he had over-tuned the encounter). However, some skillful casting from Yendar – whose Crown of Madness forced Vinny C to turn his pike on the comrades – and Strowkin – whose Thaumaturgy spell caused one of the snakes to run away like a little bitch – quickly turned the tides of the battle, although not before Korv was knocked unconscious. Then, even though the combat was pretty much won at this point, Renis implemented a daring (stupid?) combat strategy by chucking the encaged Sir Talavar into the fray and directing him to rip open a packet containing the Dust of Sneezing and Choking. And boy did Sir Talavar deliver, immediately incapacitating nearly everyone on the battlefield a veritable orgy of coughing, gasping, and other unpleasant sounds. The remaining snek tried to use this to his advantage to escape with Sir Talavar and return the fugitive to Bavlorna, but he was quickly stopped and killed by the party.</p>

<p>Having won the combat and established the superiority of Spongitelli’s pizza, the party now had to find a way to free Sir Talavar from his magical cage.</p>
