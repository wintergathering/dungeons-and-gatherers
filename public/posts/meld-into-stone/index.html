    <h1>Meld Into Stone</h1>
  </header>
  <section class="post-content"><p>At the suggestion of their newly-found compatriots, the NDA heads toward Lockbury Henge to see if the korreds – a race of stone-like humanoids native to Yon – will help them to boss up on Endelyn Moongrave. After climbing a path leading up to a plateau, the party encounters a dilapidated stone structure that looks remarkably like Nagrand Arena. Thinking the ruins might be trapped, Ankor unceremoniously asks Amidor to enter the structure first. He does so unscathed, and once the boys are satisfied that the entrance is trap-free, they follow behind.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-_Ok8tJt1lA/maxresdefault.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Inside the ruins, a keen-eyed Strowkin spots two small stone figures – one in the shape of a queen, the other in the shape of a fighter. And, in response to a really cool original power-ballad by Ankor about how much the NDA hates Endelyn Moongrave, the figures transform into Queen Argantle and Lyrel (aka Darnell), who are confirmed to be korreds.</p>
<p>Although she was impressed by Ankor’s musical prowess, she’s skeptical about doing anything to help the NDA out of fear of backing the wrong horse. She tells the adventurers that the korreds have supported others trying to take down Endelyn in the past, only to incur the wrath of Endelyn after those other parties have failed. A better way to protect her people, she says, is to hide and avoid Endelyn as much as possible.</p>
<p>That said, she says that if the party can convince her of their strength, she might offer them aid. The time-honored way that the korreds do this, and also the way that the DM spent several hours preparing, is via a battle royale. However, Yendar and the other members of the NDA are suspicious of this totally cool and totally not-a-trap trial, and so instead they manage to convince Queen Argantle to set up a 5 on 5 fight between 5 korred warriors and the NDA.</p>
<p>Somewhat exasperated, Queen Argantle calls up 3 more of her bros, and a sparring session between korreds and non-diddlers breaks out. At the beginning of the fight, the NDA is taken by surprise as the “oops all monks” team of korreds beats some cheeks. OG Darnell even manages to catch an arrow shot at him by Renis, ultimately throwing it back at Renis (but missing on the attack). Unfortunately for the korreds, though, they can’t seem to land any stunning strikes on the NDA, and the party of non-stunned non-diddlers eventually gains the upper hand. Between a fireball cast by Yendar, a potent inflict wounds cast by Strowkin, some sharpshooting from Renis, a pummeling by Korv, and the assistance of 8 (!!) horses summoned by Ankor, it’s only a matter of time before the korreds yield.</p>
<p><img src="https://24.media.tumblr.com/e5d7eec7cb35391a10e2846310dd3833/tumblr_mq9g8o45BR1ry46hlo1_400.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>Satisfied that the NDA are as strong as they claim to be, Queen Argantle agrees to help them against Endelyn. This help entails giving Renis an ancient korred heirloom, which is actually a stone of good luck, as well as telling them about a secret passage into Motherhorn (Endelyn’s stronghold) through some subterranean mines run by the brigganocks. The brigganocks, it turns out, are another race native to Yon that the korreds do not vibe with. Queen Argantle also tells the NDA that Endelyn is very into plays and has a theater set up in Motherhorn, where she often puts on (or makes her captives/servants put on) various plays.</p>
<p>While Queen Argantle is giving this information to the NDA, the NDA continuously interrupts to ask why the korreds don’t simply travel through the stone, infiltrate Motherhorn, and gank Endelyn while she’s sleeping or something. And despite Queen Argantle’s many attempts at clarifying how the <a href="https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Meld%20into%20Stone#content">Meld into Stone</a> spell works, the NDA doesn’t quite seem to get it.</p>
<p>Eventually, having established that the korreds cannot just walk through rocks and go wherever they please, Queen Argantle and Darnell try to teach the NDAa korred ritual dance that will allow them to cast “Command Hair,” a spell that will allow them to manipulate the hard-as-iron korred hair that Endelyn uses in many of her devices. But only Ankor and Korv have enough rhythm to learn the dance.</p>
