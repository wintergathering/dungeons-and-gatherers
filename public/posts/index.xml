      <description>After conquering the carousel puzzle and flirting (or trying to flirt) with Diana, the NDA decide to head toward the dragonfly ride. However, on their way there, they spot the mysterious little girl with the pig mask along with a strangely nimble toad-like creature in the crowd. Feeling themselves as a result of their carousel successes, the group tries to pursue and capture the toad-like creature, which, it turns out, doesn&amp;rsquo;t want to be captured and is fast as fuck.</description>

      <description>The Non-Diddling Adventurers (NDA) decide to leave the Lost Property hut and head toward the carousel. However, on their way there, they are confronted by a group of bandits wearing coveted dragonfly wings. The bandits, a motely crew of toughs with missing teeth/eyes, a mohawk, and several piercings, including a Prince Albert, are led by an unnamed thug wearing a deep V-neck shirt. The leader tells the NDA to give up all their money, otherwise the thugs will take it by force.</description>

      <description>Drawn by a nagging pull to recover something each of them had lost as a child, our group of adventurers finds themselves waiting in line to enter the Witchlight Carnival, a spectacle of lights, magic, and merriment. While in line, the adventurers discuss their favorite crab rangoon recipes and introduce themselves as:
Korv Brothbringer, Ankor Black, Strowkin Ahn, Renis Ratman, Tun the Toothgrabber, and Yendar Starpyre When it&amp;rsquo;s finally their turn to purchase tickets, the adventurers are greeted by Nikolas Midnight, an elderly goblin, who informs the party that a mysterious patron has already purchased tickets for the group &amp;ndash; although he&amp;rsquo;s pretty sure one of the tickets is supposed to go to a &amp;ldquo;Penis Patman&amp;rdquo; and not Renis Ratman.</description>
