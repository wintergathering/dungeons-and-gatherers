      <description>Trekking in the direction of the balloon crash, accompanied by Chet Chadly and the giant snail, the NDA finds themselves in the middle of a swamp, whose waters rise quickly and force the smaller members of the party to seek refuge, either on the shoulders of their friends or on Tensor’s Floating Disk. Tall enough to keep their heads above water, Korv and Strowkin continue wading through the swamp. However, unable to see the ground beneath their feet, they walk straight into a pit of quicksand</description>

      <description>Emerging from the mirror portal, the (now level 3) adventurers find themselves in Prismeer, high atop a broken bridge. Upon regaining their composure, Korv, Strowkin, and Rictus all felt a strange sensation in their guts that the possessions they had lost as children were in this place. But they weren’t quite sure where or how to get them back.
Nevertheless, at the edge of the bridge they found a chest full of treats (i.</description>

      <description>After winning the cupcake-eating contest and spewing vomit on their fellow carnival-goers, the NDA treks back across the grounds to meet up with Burly, who&amp;rsquo;s been instructed to take them to meet with Mr. Witch and Mr. Light. On the way, Mr. Bells reminds them of his &amp;ldquo;plan&amp;rdquo; to steal Mr. Light&amp;rsquo;s scepter, which gives him insight into the moods of all of the carnival&amp;rsquo;s attendees, and which Mr. Bells wants to use as a bargaining chip to gain information about Prismeer.</description>

      <description>After convincing Mr. Bells to return Candlefoot’s voice, the NDA discuss how they might steal Mr. Light’s magical witchlight scepter to gain leverage over the carnival owners. However, much to their chagrin, Mr. Bells doesn’t have any actual plan for how to get the scepter. He does, however, tell the adventurers that Mr. Witch and Mr. Light mostly hang out in their wagon in the staff area, which is surrounded by impassable magic thorns that only part for verified carnival staff.</description>

      <description>After conquering the carousel puzzle and flirting (or trying to flirt) with Diana, the NDA decide to head toward the dragonfly ride. However, on their way there, they spot the mysterious little girl with the pig mask along with a strangely nimble toad-like creature in the crowd. Feeling themselves as a result of their carousel successes, the group tries to pursue and capture the toad-like creature, which, it turns out, doesn&amp;rsquo;t want to be captured and is fast as fuck.</description>

      <description>The Non-Diddling Adventurers (NDA) decide to leave the Lost Property hut and head toward the carousel. However, on their way there, they are confronted by a group of bandits wearing coveted dragonfly wings. The bandits, a motely crew of toughs with missing teeth/eyes, a mohawk, and several piercings, including a Prince Albert, are led by an unnamed thug wearing a deep V-neck shirt. The leader tells the NDA to give up all their money, otherwise the thugs will take it by force.</description>

      <description>Drawn by a nagging pull to recover something each of them had lost as a child, our group of adventurers finds themselves waiting in line to enter the Witchlight Carnival, a spectacle of lights, magic, and merriment. While in line, the adventurers discuss their favorite crab rangoon recipes and introduce themselves as:
Korv Brothbringer, Ankor Black, Strowkin Ahn, Renis Ratman, Tun the Toothgrabber, and Yendar Starpyre When it&amp;rsquo;s finally their turn to purchase tickets, the adventurers are greeted by Nikolas Midnight, an elderly goblin, who informs the party that a mysterious patron has already purchased tickets for the group &amp;ndash; although he&amp;rsquo;s pretty sure one of the tickets is supposed to go to a &amp;ldquo;Penis Patman&amp;rdquo; and not Renis Ratman.</description>
