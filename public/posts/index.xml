      <description>Drawn by a nagging pull to recover something each of them had lost as a child, our group of adventurers finds themselves waiting in line to enter the Witchlight Carnival, a spectacle of lights, magic, and merriment. While in line, the adventurers discuss their favorite crab rangoon recipes and introduce themselves as:
Korv Brothbringer, Ankor Black, Strowkin Ahn, Renis Ratman, Tun the Toothgrabber, and Yendar Starpyre When it&amp;rsquo;s finally their turn to purchase tickets, the adventurers are greeted by Nikolas Midnight, an elderly goblin, who informs the party that a mysterious patron has already purchased tickets for the group &amp;ndash; although he&amp;rsquo;s pretty sure one of the tickets is supposed to go to a &amp;ldquo;Penis Patman&amp;rdquo; and not Renis Ratman.</description>
