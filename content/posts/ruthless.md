Having successfully defeated (well, sort of) Bavlorna Blightstraw, member of the Hourglass Coven and ruler of Downfall, the NDA find themselves ganking items out of her frog-statue-treasure-hoard, including 6 glamerweave cloaks as well as a handful of leaves, which Renis promptly pockets. And thanks to a flying kick from Korv, they also manage to bust open a locked treasure chest that contains a creepy-looking (but nonmagical) marionette and an unpunched ticket to the Witchlight Carnival.

Following a prolonged discussion with Clapperclaw about converting Bavlorna’s lakehouse into an Airbnb rental property, the gang finally decides that it’s time to leave Hither and head over to Thither, where they hope to track down Skabatha Nightshade. Fortunately, Clapperclaw knows how to get from Hither to Thither, and once the adventurers steal the last skin balloon – along with several bottles of wine – from Duke Ickrind, the NDA is on the road. Well, in the air.

After a casual trip through the mists of Prismeer, Clapperclaw lands the balloon in Thither, an enchanted forest that’s a welcome change from the swamps of Hither. Eager to get back to his new gig as a property manager/slumlord, Clapperclaw offers to guide the party to Nib’s Cave, and he vaguely describes Nib as an old man afflicted by a curse that has something to do with giving people gold, which sounds pretty fucking rad to the NDA. However, shortly after starting out to find Nib, Strowkin finds a wanted poster pinned to a nearby tree. To the person who captures Will of the Feywild for Skabatha, the poster promises that Skabatha will “ensure that no sword can ever break their skin.” Although the gang is pretty sure that Skabatha sucks, Strowkin still opts to hold onto the poster, just in case.

Still en route to Nib’s cave, the NDA finds tracks from a huge monster impressed into the ground. Yendar confirms that the tracks are, indeed, larger than him by laying down in one. Nobody in the NDA is quite able to pinpoint exactly what made the tracks, but there’s some speculation that they may be from a dragon (or something similar).

Either way, rather than follow the tracks off to the west, the gang opts to continue toward Nib’s cave and the promise of gold.

As they near the cave, though, they find an abandoned chariot with an owlbear named Juniper harnessed to it. After befriending the owlbear by feeding it an assortment of pocket eggs, the NDA coopts the chariot, with Korv hopping in to captain the craft. Strowkin tries to climb atop Juniper and ride her like a horse, but after the owlbear strains under the weight of his 22 stone, he sensibly chooses to walk instead.

Finally, the gang arrives at Nib’s Cave and bids adieu to their longtime friend and confidant, Clapperclaw, but not before charging him with gentrifying Downfall and allowing him to sign up for as many streaming services as he desires.

Inside the cave, the NDA meet Nib, a wrinkled old man who was cursed by Skabatha and now has to basically make cool shit out of an endless pile of gold for all eternity (or at least until Skabatha is killed), all while being poked in the back by apparitions of the people he wronged in his past life. But the party basically doesn’t give a fuck about Nib (except for Strowkin, who does try to dispel the apparitions), and rather than empathizing with his plight, they spend a considerable amount of time trying to figure out just how many gold-spun gifts they can get from him. Ultimately, they receive the following:

- Korv and Tickolas Sage get matching gold chains with carving forks
- Yendar gets a bunch of rings that spell out SPONG
- Strowkin gets a grill
- Renis gets golden heelies
- Ankor gets a gold strap for his guitar
- Juniper gets a golden tiara

And beyond these gifts they get immediately, they also place orders for statues of themselves (to be displayed in the Airbnb), a solid-gold big titty chia pet, and a couple of long golden dongers for Korv and Renis.

During the conversation, Nib also tells the boys about Will of the Feywild, a Peter-Pan-like boy who rescues enslaved children from Skabatha’s workshop and takes them to his hideout at Little Oak. And though Nib can’t go with the NDA to Little Oak, he does tell them how to get their, plus tells them about a Vermont Vinny’s Sandwich Shop run by one of Will’s compatriots.
