Drawn by a nagging pull to recover something each of them had lost as a child, our group of adventurers finds themselves waiting in line to enter the *Witchlight Carnival,* a spectacle of lights, magic, and merriment. While in line, the adventurers discuss their favorite crab rangoon recipes and introduce themselves as:

- Korv Brothbringer,
- Ankor Black,
- Strowkin Ahn,
- Renis Ratman,
- Tun the Toothgrabber, and
- Yendar Starpyre

When it's finally their turn to purchase tickets, the adventurers are greeted by Nikolas Midnight, an elderly goblin, who informs the party that a mysterious patron has already purchased tickets for the group -- although he's pretty sure one of the tickets is supposed to go to a "Penis Patman" and not Renis Ratman. Nevertheless, Nikolas describes the Witchlight Carnival to the adventurers, informing them of several rules and procedures of the carnival. He tells the adventurers that each ticket has **8 punches** that can be used to gain admittance to carnival attractions (like an inverse Subway reward card). Patrons who use all of their punches can return to the ticket booth and buy a new ticket. He also emphasizes that every carnival-goer who has purchased tickets must wear a set of *butterfly wings* to indicate that they have paid to enter the carnival. And unfortunately for the party, Nikolas does not have any dragonfly wings to wear in lieu of butterfly wings, although he does find a pair of children's wings for Yendar to wear. During their exchange, Nikolas gets a bad vibe from Renis/Penis, and makes a note to have the carnival staff watch him closely.

Once the adventurers have securely affixed their wings to their backs, Nikolas tells them about a handful of events that occur at specific times, such as the **Big Top Extravaganza** that takes place 4 hours after the carnival opens for the night. During the extravaganza, the carnival's performers sing, dance, and perform tricks. Attendees are also given the chance to take the stage and try their hand(s) at entertaining the crowd. And at the end of the night, the **Witchlight Monarch** is crowned, with this person usually being the one who has contributed the most to the cheer of the carnival that day.

After talking with Nikolas, Strowkin Ahn directly into the main thoroughfare and begins preaching the gospel of Freyr, the deity that Strowkin follows. However, a family of rabbitfolk is dismayed when Strowkin doesn't even have a pamphlet for them to read over.

In the main thoroughfare, the party then meets *Northwind,* a 12-foot-tall tree-person, and *Red,* a sentient squirrel, and each member of the party chooses whether they want to receive a welcome gift from Red or Northwind in the form of a different type of seed.

Yender then proposes that the group visit the **Lost Property** tent, where they meet a displacer beast named *Dirlagraun*. *Dirlagraun* is responsible for overseeing the tent, and there are two children (*Viro* and *Allowin*) with him, waiting for their parents to return. Dirlagraun gets pissed when Allowin starts playing with a mirrored ball, which causes Viro to run away in fright. Unable to leave Allowin alone, Dirlagraun asks the group to go find Viro. Eventually, Ankor finds the boy crouched down by a candy stall, eating a candied apple. After assuring the stall's owner that he is not a kiddy diddler, Ankor returns Viro to Dirlagraun, at which point Dirlagraun reveals that his son, Star, has been missing for years, and the ball used to belong to him. After once again assuring Dirlagraun that they're not out to diddle anyone, the group agrees to keep an eye open for Dirlagraun's missing child. Starting to trust these non-diddling adventurers more, Dirlagraun suggests that the group visit some of his favorite spots in the carnival next -- the **carousel,** the **snail racetrack,** or the **feasting orchard.**
