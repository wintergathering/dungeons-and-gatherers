Having successfully crossed the bridge in Rivenwish Chasm, the NDA meet Obud, the Elder Brigganock, who lives in a small cabin attached to his horse, Keg’s, back. And after everyone has had a chance to spit on their hand and greet Obud, the boys finally get down to brass tacks. They tell Obud that they’re trying to fuck up Endelyn, and he agrees to show them the secret tunnel into Motherhorn in exchange for…an assortment of food provided by the NDA.

Korv uses this as an opportunity to make a tiramisu. Although Korv absolutely delivered on making a delectable treat, Obud’s response is…not quite as enthusiastic as Korv would like, which put the K-man in a bit of a sour mood.

Either way, after receiving a lot of the food that the NDA had been carrying around since they started their adventure, Obud shows the crew the secret tunnel into Motherhorn. Before sending them on their way, he asks for them to look out for Grolmo, the lead Brigganock architect, who was taken captive by Endelyn.

Led by Tickolas Sage (adorned with some glowing dick-wishes), the party travel through the tunnel and eventually end up in a prop storage room in the basement of Motherhorn. There, they meet Break-a-Leg, a sentient marionette tangled in his own strings. Korv tests Break-a-Leg’s character by asking the marionette if he returns his carts to the corral after shopping, and, satisfied by his answer, agrees to untangle him.

Break-a-Leg then tells the boys that he was an early experiment of Endelyn’s, and he was cast aside when he turned out to be not-evil-enough. DM’s note: Endelyn for sure doesn’t return her carts. During the exchange, Break-a-leg also reveals the following:

- Endelyn uses a device called the Orrery of Tragedies to see visions of the future (not exact visions – more like prophecies)

- Endelyn is super into plays, and she requires most visitors to perform in plays before she’ll grant them an audience

- Several things in Motherhorn have been constructed using korred hair, including the stage curtains and pieces of the Orrery of Tragedies.

It’s at this point that the budding relationship between the NDA and Break-a-Leg goes sideways. Break-a-Leg wants to leave Motherhorn and strike out on his own, but the NDA still doesn’t trust him. And, spurred by some lingering resentment about Obud’s lackluster reaction to his tiramisu, Korv suddenly snaps Break-a-Leg in half across his knee. Ankor burns his body, and stuffs his head into his pack.

But the show must go on! The boys ride the elevator up to the stage level, where they’re greeted by Stagefright, a goblin who serves as Motherhorn’s master of ceremonies. He tells them that Endelyn foresaw their arrival and asked him to greet the adventurers. The goblin informs the party that they’ll be performing a play for Endelyn shortly, which leads to a prolonged discussion about what type of play they should perform and whether they ought to send people to sneak out to sabotage the Orrery during the performance. As far as the DM can tell, the upcoming play will involve *checks notes* a Mitsubishi Eclipse, Eclipse gum, the plot from Speed, and gay pirates, all of which will be tied together in a sort of meta-plot where Endelyn is victorious over a group of adventurers trying to kill her during an eclipse. Plus Ankor writes a song (but not the best song in the world).

Once the party is ready, Stagefright fetches Endelyn down to the stage to await the start of the play.
